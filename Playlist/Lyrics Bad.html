      <b><p>&#9664; Chorus &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>How could my day be bad</p>
      <p>When I'm with you?</p>
      <p>You're the only one</p>
      <p>Who makes me laugh</p>
      <p>So how can my day be bad?</p>
      <p>It's a day for you</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Verse 1 &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>Lately, life's so boring</p>
      <p>I've been watching Netflix all day long</p>
      <p>I thought there would be</p>
      <p>No things left to watch</p>
      <p>So I let myself out</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Pre-Chorus &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>When I went to the park</p>
      <p>I recognized you at a glance</p>
      <p>Face to face, we just smiled</p>
      <p>We already know that we'll be together</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Chorus &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>How could my day be bad</p>
      <p>When I'm with you?</p>
      <p>You're the only one</p>
      <p>Who makes me laugh</p>
      <p>So how can my day be bad?</p>
      <p>It's a day for you</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Verse 2 &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>Coffee in the morning, you and the sun</p>
      <p>There's a brown hue in your eyes</p>
      <p>How pretty it is</p>
      <p>I think I'm in love</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Pre-Chorus &#9654;</p></b>
      <p>When I went to the park</p>
      <p>I recognized you at a glance</p>
      <p>Face to face, we just smiled</p>
      <p>And I finally held your hands</p>
      <br>
      <b><p>&#9664; Chorus &#9654;</p></b>

      <p>Who makes me laugh</p>
      <p>So how can my day be bad?</p>
      <p>It's a day for you</p>
      <p>How could my day be bad</p>
      <p>When I'm with you?</p>
      <p>You're the only one</p>
      <p>Who makes me laugh</p>
      <p>So how can my day be bad?</p>
      <p>It's a day for you</p>
