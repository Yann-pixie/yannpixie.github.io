        <br>
        <b><p>&#9664; Verse 1 &#9654;</p></b>
        <p>I saw you on the way to my favorite place</p>
        <p>Just something about the way</p>
        <p>You walked into the shop</p>
        <p>How you said your name</p>
        <p>Could this be</p>
        <p>Could you be someone</p>
        <p>I'm not usually the type to be having these thoughts</p>
        <p>How could you give me the butterflies</p>
        <p>When I met your eyes you flashed a smile</p>
        <p>I'm hoping that you'll stay a while</p>
        <br>
        <b><p>&#9664; Pre-Chorus &#9654;</p></b>
        <p>Oh, tell me what you came for</p>
        <p>Honestly I don't know if you'll stay or not</p>
        <p>But for now I'm betting on us cause I</p>

        <p>I had some plans</p>
        <p>But I'm having second thoughts</p>
        <p>You kept taking glances across the coffee shop</p>
        <p>Maybe we could sit and just do nothing</p>
        <p>But it's not like I mind</p>
        <p>That's my favorite time</p>
        <p>You said you liked my smile but I don't get it</p>
        <p>Still not really sure if you meant it</p>
        <p>But my face still turning redder than your sweatshirt</p>
        <p>You know that Imma stay a while</p>
